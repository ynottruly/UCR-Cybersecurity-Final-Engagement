# UCR-Cybersecurity-Final-Engagement

**Description**

In a similar vein to Project 2, in this third and final project, we were tasked with performing the duties of a Red Team pen tester and a Blue Team SOC analyst, with the added wrinkle of inspecting network traffic using Wireshark.

**Objectives**

- Discover/Exploit vulnerabilities and perform a pen test on a WordPress server using Kali
- Implement Alarms/Thresholds on the server using Kibana
- Analyze the malicious traffic using Wireshark

Please see the Red Team, Blue Team, and Network Analysis pages for a full summary of all three aspects of the project.

In addition, you can view the Presentation that I presented with classmates whom I collaborated with on the Red Team portion of this project.
